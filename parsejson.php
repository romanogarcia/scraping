1. Domains to get recipes from and contents (here are some we can look into)

Allrecipes
Tasty.co okay
foodnetwork.com not
delish.com not
simplyrecipes.com okay
spendwithpennies.com
pillsbury.com
skinnytaste.com
cookingclassy.com
gimmesomeoven.com
cafedelites.com
cookieandkate.com
dinneratthezoo.com
dinnerthendessert.com


2. What are the data we need to scrape

Domain Name
Recipe Title:
Image:
Video?
Description
Ingredients:
Direction:
Servings
Prep Time
Cook Time
Custom time
Main Category
Sub Category
Nutrition Facts

3. How it will look like and how to manipulate data on the backend

Requirements
Can view the content and move the content over to the new page
Can record domain id - do mapping example: code 01 is from Domain1 etc
Editor can edit the title
Editor can edit/ add photos inside the system
Editor can view the video but would not be able to copy on our site, can add videos inside the system
Editors can view the body description but wont be able to add it in. Hence they can add a new one
Editor can manipulate the ingredients or can add a converter. Current plugin has one
Can move direction and can edit
Can move serving value
Can move Prep, Cook and Custom Time, Editor can calculate the total
Can move and edit cat and sub cat
Editor can view the Nutrition Facts but can also do calculation using the plugin
